# Design

## Colour Scheme
 -   The two main primary colours used are green (#005247) dark green (#0E2925)
 -   Supported by orange (#e08000)

<h2 align="center"><img src=assets/images/colour.jpg></h2>

According to the psychology of colour, green represent balance and harmony and a darker shade of green symbolise ambition and wealth.  A gradient of both colours creates the perfect representation of the business brand. The orange colour creates a great contrast with the green background, increasing the readability and image of the chef working in the hot kitchen.


## Typography
-   Pacifico

Pacifico will be used exclusively on the Chef Dicson logo. The reason I chose Pacifico is the simplicity and fluidity of the script typeface. It conveys the feelings of being fun, easy-going, and hassle-free. 

-   Quicksand (Included all font weight)
    
And it accompanies by Quicksand font, a round sans-serif typeface that conveys a sense of friendliness and reliability. It also has great readability. 

## Imagery
-   Imagery is important. The large, main image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. 
-   The pictures showcase chef ability and skills.
