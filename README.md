##  Design

  -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main primary colours used are dark green (#005247)
        -   Supported by orange (#e08000)

        According to the psychology of colour, green represent balance and harmony and a darker shade of green symbolise ambition and wealth.  A gradient of both colours creates the perfect representation of the business brand. The orange colour creates a great contrast with the green background, increasing the readability and image of the chef working in the hot kitchen.

  -   #### Typography
        -   Font Pacifico
        -   Font Quicksand
    
        Pacifico will be used exclusively on the Chef Dicson logo. The reason I chose Pacifico is the simplicity and fluidity of the script typeface. It conveys the feelings of being fun, easy-going, and hassle-free. And it accompanies by Quicksand font, a round sans-serif typeface that conveys a sense of friendliness, reliable and has great readability. 

  -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. The picture showcase chef ability and skills.

        Carousel of culinary dishes designed to showcase new and interesting delicious dishes constantly serve to site visitors. An opportunity to showcase Chef Dicson portfolio of culinary inventions. 
  -   #### Main landing page layout
        -   Header - Logo and navigation bar accompanied by main eye catching images.
        -   Main content - CV, career timeline, 
        -   Private chef services
        -   Carousel of culinary invention
